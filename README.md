# Quantitative backtesting

ABSTRACTION:

This project detils the creation of a Securities database that will be used in analysis of finnancial securities and also to backtest algorithmic trading strategies. The majority of the setup is completed with open source software, a MySQL database and the Python scripting language. Credit also goes to the Micheal Halls-Moore, for his articles on Quantstart.com helped me in the creation of some of the work. 

INTRODUCTION:

To start, I have created 3 tables in a MySQL Database which is stored on my local computer for the time being.
